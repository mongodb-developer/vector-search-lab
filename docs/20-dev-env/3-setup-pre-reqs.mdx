# üëê Setup prerequisites

Set the passkey provided by your workshop instructor, and run the cells under the **Step 1: Setup prerequisites** section in the notebook.

### If your passkey has expired

The passkey provided to you during the workshop will be valid for 3 days after the workshop. Once the passkey expires, or if you weren't at a MongoDB Developer Day recently, you will need to obtain a Voyage AI API key for the workshop.
* Follow the steps here to [obtain a Voyage AI API key](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/api-key-and-installation#authentication-with-api-keys).
* Set the `VOYAGE_API_KEY` environment variable in the notebook as follows:

```python
os.environ["VOYAGE_API_KEY"] = "your-voyageai-api-key"
```

### If you are running the lab locally

If you aren't using Instruqt or GitHub Codespaces to run the lab and instead running it locally, you will need to do the following additional steps:

* Spin up a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and obtain its connection string:

    * Register for a [free MongoDB Atlas account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) if you don't already have one
    * [Create a new database cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/cluster)
    * [Obtain the connection string](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/connection-string) for your database cluster

* Set the `MONGODB_URI` variable in the notebook as follows:

```python
MONGODB_URI = "your_connection_string"
```
