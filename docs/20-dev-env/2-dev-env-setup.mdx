# üëê Setup dev environment

:::tip
In this lab, we will be using Jupyter Notebooks, which is an interactive Python environment. If you are new to Jupyter Notebooks, use <a href="./jupyter-notebooks">this</a> guide to familiarize yourself with the environment.
:::

## Option 1: GitHub Codespaces

You will be working in GitHub Codespaces throughout this lab. A codespace is a cloud-hosted, containerized development environment that comes pre-configured with all the tools you need to run this lab.

Navigate to [this](https://github.com/codespaces/new/mongodb-developer/genai-devday-notebooks?quickstart=1) link. You will be prompted to sign into GitHub if you haven't already. Once signed in, click the **Create new codespace** button to create a new codespace.

Let it run for a few seconds as it prepares a Docker container with all the required libraries and a MongoDB cluster.

### Connect to the MongoDB cluster

Once the environment is built, you will be prompted to connect to the MongoDB cluster via MongoDB's VSCode extension. This will allow you to visualize the data that we will import into the cluster later in the lab, directly from the VSCode IDE.

To connect to the cluster, click the **Connect** button.

In the modal that appears at the top of the screen, enter the string `mongodb://admin:mongodb@mongodb:27017/` and hit `Enter` on your keyboard.

If the connection was successful, you should see **Connected to: mongodb:27017** with a green indicator.

You can view the default and any additional collections we create on the cluster during the lab by clicking the leaf icon in the left navigation bar of the IDE.

### Jupyter Notebook setup

You will be filling code in a Jupyter Notebook during this lab, so let's get set up with that next!

Click on the files icon in the left navigation bar. In the Explorer menu, under `notebooks`, click on the file named `vector-search-lab.ipynb` to open the Jupyter Notebook for this lab.

Next, select the Python interpreter by clicking **Select Kernel** at the top right of the IDE.

In the modal that appears, click **Python environments...** and select the interpreter that is marked as **Recommended** or **Global Env**.

That's it! You're ready for the lab!

## Option 2: Run locally

:::caution
During the lab, we will use GitHub Codespaces. These instructions are here just in case you can't use Codespaces or if you really, really, really want a local installation.
:::

To run the lab locally, follow the steps below: 

* Clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/genai-devday-notebooks.git) for this lab by executing the following command from the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/mongodb-developer/genai-devday-notebooks.git
```

* `cd` into the `notebooks` directory of the cloned repository:

```
cd genai-devday-notebooks/notebooks
```

* Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```
python -m venv vector-search-lab
source vector-search-lab/bin/activate
```

* Install the dependencies for this lab:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Install and launch Jupyter Notebook:

```
pip install notebook
jupyter notebook
```

* In the browser tab that pops up, open the file named `vector-search-lab.ipynb`.
