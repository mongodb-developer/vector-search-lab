# üëê Setup dev environment

:::tip
In this lab, we will be using Jupyter Notebooks, which is an interactive Python environment. If you are new to Jupyter Notebooks, use <a href="./jupyter-notebooks">this</a> guide to familiarize yourself with the environment.

## Option 1: GitHub Codespaces

You will be working in a Jupyter Notebook in a GitHub Codespace throughout this lab. A codespace is a cloud-hosted, containerized development environment that comes pre-configured with all the tools you need to run this lab.

Navigate to [this](https://github.com/codespaces/new/mongodb-developer/genai-devday-notebooks?quickstart=1) link. You will be prompted to sign into GitHub if you haven't already. Once signed in, click the **Create new codespace** button to create a new codespace.

Let it run for a few seconds as it prepares a Docker container with all the required libraries and a MongoDB cluster. Once the environment is built, you should see a VS Code IDE with a list of files under the Explorer tab. 

In the Explorer menu, under `notebooks`, click on the file named `vector-search-lab.ipynb` to open the Jupyter Notebook for this lab.

Next, select the Python interpreter by clicking **Select Kernel** at the top right of the IDE.

In the modal that appears, click **Python environments...** and select the interpreter that is marked as **Recommended** or **Global Env**.

That's it! You're ready for the lab!

    In the left navigation bar of the IDE, click on the leaf icon. Under Connections, click the **Add Connection** button.

    In the tab that appears, click the **Connect** button.

    In the modal that appears at the top of the screen, enter the string `mongodb://admin:mongodb@mongodb:27017/` and hit `Enter` on your keyboard.

    If the connection was successful, you should see the cluster and its default databases under Connections. Any additional databases and collections created during the lab will appear here as well.

## Option 2: Run locally

:::caution
During the lab, we will use GitHub Codespaces. These instructions are here just in case you can't use Codespaces or if you really, really, really want a local installation.
:::

To run the lab locally, follow the steps below: 

* Clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/genai-devday-notebooks.git) for this lab by executing the following command from the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/mongodb-developer/genai-devday-notebooks.git
```

* `cd` into the cloned directory:

```
cd genai-devday-notebooks
```

* Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```
python -m venv vector-search-lab
source vector-search-lab/bin/activate
```

* Install the dependencies for this lab:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Install and launch Jupyter Notebook:

```
pip install notebook
jupyter notebook
```

* In the browser tab that pops up, open the file named `vector-search-lab.ipynb`.
