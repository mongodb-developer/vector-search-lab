# ðŸ“˜ Running Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks is an interactive Python environment.

## Cells
Cells in a Jupyter notebook are a modular unit of code or text that you can execute and view outputs for.

## Running a cell
To run a cell in a Jupyter notebook, hover over it and click the Run icon that appears against the cell.

When a cell is running, you will see a loading spinner in the bottom left corner of the cell.

## Successful cell runs
When a cell is finished running successfully, you will see a green check mark appear in the bottom left corner of the cell.

## Erroneous cell runs
If an error occurred while running a cell, you will see a red cross appear in the bottom left corner of the cell, and also an error traceback after the cell.

To fix errors, you may need to update previous cells. If you do, re-run all the cells following the one(s) you updated.

## Interrupting a cell
To interrupt a running cell, click the Stop icon that you see against the cell while it is running.
