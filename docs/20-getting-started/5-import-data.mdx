# üëê Import data into MongoDB

Let's first import a dataset to use for this lab. We will use a collection of books.

Run the cells under the **Step 2: Import data** section in the notebook to import the dataset for this lab into a MongoDB collection.

To verify that the data has been imported into your MongoDB cluster, navigate to the **Overview** page in the Atlas UI. In the **Clusters section**, select your cluster and click **Browse collections**.

Ensure that you see a database called _mongodb_genai_devday_, and a collection named _books_ under it. Note the number and format of documents in the collection.
