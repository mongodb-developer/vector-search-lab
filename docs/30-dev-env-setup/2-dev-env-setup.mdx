# üëê Setup dev environment

:::tip
In this lab, we will be using Jupyter Notebooks, which is an interactive Python environment. If you are new to Jupyter Notebooks, use <a href="./jupyter-notebooks">this</a> guide to familiarize yourself with the environment.
:::

## Option 1: GitHub Codespaces

You will be working in a Jupyter Notebook in a GitHub Codespace throughout this lab. A codespace is a cloud-hosted, containerized development environment that comes pre-configured with all the tools you need to run this lab.

Navigate to [this](https://github.com/codespaces/new/mongodb-developer/genai-devday-notebooks?quickstart=1) link. You will be prompted to sign into GitHub if you haven't already. Once signed in, click the **Create new codespace** button to create a new codespace.

Let it run for a few seconds as it prepares your environment. It will clone the repository, prepare the container, and run the installation scripts. Once the environment is built, you should see a list of files appear under the Explorer. 

In the left navigation bar of the IDE, click on the file named `vector-search-lab.ipynb` to open the Jupyter Notebook for this lab.

Next, select the Python interpreter by clicking **Select Kernel** at the top right of the IDE.

In the modal that appears, click **Python environments...** and select the interpreter that is marked as **Recommended** or **Global Env**.

That's it! You're ready for the lab!

## Option 2: Run locally

:::caution
During the lab, we will use GitHub Codespaces. These instructions are here just in case you can't use Codespaces or if you really, really, really want a local installation.
:::

If you want to run the notebook locally, follow the steps below:

* Clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/genai-devday-notebooks.git) for this lab by executing the following command from the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/mongodb-developer/genai-devday-notebooks.git
```

* `cd` into the cloned directory:

```
cd genai-devday-notebooks
```

* Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```
python -m venv vector-search-lab
source vector-search-lab/bin/activate
```

* Install the dependencies for this lab:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Install and launch Jupyter Notebook:

```
pip install notebook
jupyter notebook
```

* In the browser tab that pops up, open the file named `vector-search-lab.ipynb`.
