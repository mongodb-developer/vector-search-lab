# 👩‍💻 Running Docusaurus Locally

## Run in development

Once you start your site, you should see changes as you save (no need to reload manually)

```shell
npm start
```

But sometimes we don't see our changes, or some error appears (esp when deleting folder with docs in the [docs folder](structure-site/docs-folder))

To fix this, stop docusaurus and restart it `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## Run in production

## Search and Localization only works with Production builds

The [Offline / Local plugin](https://github.com/cmfcmf/docusaurus-search-local) is installed to provide search. It only works on production builds, won't work while we're running the development build.

To test the search plugin locally or multi-language support you need to generate a production build, then serve it:

```shell
npm run build && npm run serve
```
