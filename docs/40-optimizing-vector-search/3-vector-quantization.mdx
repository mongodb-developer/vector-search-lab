# üëê Vector quantization

Vector quantization is a technique to reduce the number of bits required to represent a vector. This can help reduce the storage and memory requirements for vector embeddings.

We support two types of quantization in MongoDB Atlas i.e. `scalar` and `binary`. Refer to our [documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-quantization/#about-quantization) to learn more about quantization.

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 9: Enable vector quantization** section in the notebook to enable auto-quantization on your embeddings.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:

**CODE_BLOCK_16**
