# üëê Changing the similarity metric

MongoDB Atlas Vector Search supports different distance metrics to determine nearest neighbors during vector search. Refer to our [documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-search-type/#std-label-avs-similarity-functions) to learn more about the supported distance metrics.

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 8: Changing the similarity metric** section in the notebook to experiment with a different similarity metric for vector search.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:

**CODE_BLOCK_15**
