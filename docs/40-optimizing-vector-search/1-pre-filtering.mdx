# üëê Pre-filtering

Pre-filtering is a technique to optimize vector search by only considering documents that match certain criteria during vector search.

In this section, you will learn how to combine filters with vector search. This mainly involves:
* Updating the vector search index to include the appropriate filter fields
* Updating the `$vectorSearch` stage in the aggregation pipeline definition to include the filters

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 7: Adding pre-filters to your vector search** section in the notebook to experiment with combining pre-filters with your vector search queries.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:
