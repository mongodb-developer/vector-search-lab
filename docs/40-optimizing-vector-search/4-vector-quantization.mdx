# üëê Vector quantization

Vector quantization is a technique to reduce the number of bits required to represent a vector. This can help reduce the storage and memory requirements for vector embeddings.

To enable vector auto-quantization on your embeddings, simply set the `quantization` field to one of the supported quantization types (`scalar or `binary`) in the vector search index definition.

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 9: Enable vector quantization** section in the notebook to enable auto-quantization on your embeddings.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:

**CODE_BLOCK_16**
