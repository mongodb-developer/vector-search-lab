# ðŸ“˜ find()

The `find()` method is used to perform traditional queries in MongoDB, to retrieve documents from a collection based on specified criteria.

It supports exact matching, range queries, and other query types using the MongoDB Query API.

Use `find()` when you need to retrieve documents that match specific field values or conditions.

### Usage Example
```python
db.collection.find({ "name": "Alice" })
```
