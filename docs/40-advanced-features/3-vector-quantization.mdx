# üìòüëê Vector Quantization

Vector Quantization is a technique to reduce the number of bits that represent a vector. This can help reduce the storage and memory requirements for vector embeddings.

Atlas Vector Search supports automatic quantization of double or 32-bit float values in your vector embeddings. You can set the quantization method for vector type fields in your index definition.
