# 📘👐 Similarity Functions

Atlas Vector Search supports different similarity functions to search for top K-nearest neighbors. You can set the similarity function for vector type fields in your index definition.

* `euclidean` - measures the distance between ends of vectors.
* `cosine` - measures similarity based on the angle between vectors.
* `dotProduct` - measures similarity like cosine, but takes into account the magnitude of the vector.
