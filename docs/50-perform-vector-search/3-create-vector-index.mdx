# üëê Create a vector search index

To retrieve documents from MongoDB using vector search, you must configure a vector search index on the collection into which you ingested your data.

You can create vector search indexes using the Atlas web UI, Atlas CLI, Compass, or any MongoDB driver. We'll create a vector search index using the Python driver.

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 5: Create a vector search index** section in the notebook to create a vector search index on the `books` collection.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:
