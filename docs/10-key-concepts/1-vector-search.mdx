## Vector

A vector is an array of numbers that represents your data in multiple dimensions. Vectors can represent any kind of data, from text, image, and audio data to unstructured data. Semantic similarity is determined by measuring the distance between vectors.

Vector dimensions refer to the number of elements in the array, and therefore the number of dimensions in vector space where the vectors are plotted.

## Vector search

Vector search is a search method that returns results based on your data's semantic, or underlying, meaning. Unlike traditional full-text search which finds text matches, vector search finds vectors that are close to your search query in multi-dimensional space. The closer the vectors are to your query, the more similar they are in meaning.

Vector search allows you to query your data based on semantic meaning rather than just keyword matches, which helps you retrieve more relevant search results. It enables your AI-powered applications to support use cases such as semantic search, hybrid search, and generative search, including RAG.

## Atlas Vector Search

You can use Atlas Vector Search to perform vector search on your data stored in Atlas. 

By using Atlas as a vector database, you can seamlessly index vector data along with your other data in Atlas. This allows you to filter on fields in your collection and perform vector search queries against vector data.
