If you're using your own database, you will need to manually set the value of the `MONGODB_URI` variable with your connection string:

```python
MONGODB_URI = "<<your connection string>>"
```

Also, if running the lab locally, set the value of the `SERVERLESS_URL` variable:

```python
SERVERLESS_URL = "https://vtqjvgchmwcjwsrela2oyhlegu0hwqnw.lambda-url.us-west-2.on.aws/"
```
