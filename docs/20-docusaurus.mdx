# ðŸ¦– Docusaurus 

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a tool to generate documentation sites like this very one you're using right now. Created at Facebook, it's [open source](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) and well maintained.

In their own words:

> Docusaurus is a project for building, deploying, and maintaining open source project websites easily.

:::tip
You can even [try Docusaurus in a Playground](https://docusaurus.io/docs/playground) without installing anything!

## Why?

When we write a new Quick Start, blog post, we shoot a video etc. we're generating different artifacts that can be reused later. Creating step by step Workshops for some of the most demanded makes total sense as different DevRel people can reuse them, in demos, booths, etc.

## Editor

Use the editor that makes you happy (or Emacs if you're Jorge), but all the screenshots here will be showing Visual Studio Code.
