# üëê Add embeddings to the data

Now that you know how to generate embeddings using the CLIP model, let's add embeddings to the books dataset you previously imported into MongoDB.

This is a common scenario you will run into where you might want to update your existing data in MongoDB with embeddings. 

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 4: Adding embeddings to existing data in Atlas** section in the notebook to add embeddings of the books' cover images to the documents in the `books` collection.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:

    Click on the leaf icon in the left navigation bar of the IDE.
    
    Navigate to a document in the _books_ collection and ensure that it has an `embedding` field.
