# üëê Create a vector search index

To retrieve documents from MongoDB using vector search, you must configure a vector search index on the collection into which you ingested your data. In this lab, you will programmatically create vector search indexes using MongoDB's Python driver.

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 5: Create a vector search index** section in the notebook to create a vector search index on the `books` collection.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:
