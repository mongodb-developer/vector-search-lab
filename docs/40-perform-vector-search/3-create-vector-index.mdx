# üëê Create a vector search index

To retrieve documents from MongoDB using vector search, you must configure a vector search index on the collection into which you ingested your data. In this lab, you will programmatically create vector search indexes using MongoDB's Python driver.

Run the cells under the **Step 5: Create a vector search index** section in the notebook to create a vector search index on the `books` collection.
