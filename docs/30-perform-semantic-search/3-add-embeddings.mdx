# üëê Add embeddings to the data in MongoDB

Now that you know how to generate embeddings using the CLIP model, let's add embeddings to the books dataset you previously imported into MongoDB.

This is a common scenario you will run into where you might already have data in MongoDB that you want to update with embeddings. 

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 4: Adding Embeddings to Existing Data in Atlas** section in the notebook to add embeddings of the books' cover image to the documents in the `books` collection.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:
