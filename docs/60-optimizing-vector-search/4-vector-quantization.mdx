# üëê Vector quantization

Vector quantization is a technique to reduce the number of bits required to represent a vector. This can help reduce the storage and memory requirements for vector embeddings.

To enable vector auto-quantization on your embeddings, simply set the `quantization` field to one of the supported quantization types (`scalar` or `binary`) in the vector search index definition.

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 9: Enable vector quantization** section in the notebook to enable auto-quantization on your embeddings.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:

**CODE_BLOCK_17**

:::info
Notice the slight increase in the size of the vector search index upon enabling quantization. This is because full-fidelity vectors are also stored on disk for re-scoring and/or exact nearest neighbors (ENN) search.

In the Atlas UI, the entire index size is displayed, which might be larger than the original index size, since Atlas does not show a break down of the data structures within an index that are stored in RAM and on disk.

The Atlas Search metrics however will show a much smaller index that is held in memory when you enable automatic quantization. Refer to our [documentation](https://deploy-preview-6486--cloud-docs.netlify.app/atlas-vector-search/deployment-options/#storage-requirements-for-vectors) to learn more about these considerations.
