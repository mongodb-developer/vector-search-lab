If you are new to Jupyter Notebooks, use this guide to familiarize yourself with the environment. You have a few different options to run this lab. Our preferred platform is Instruqt. If for some reason, you are unable to access the lab through Instruqt, try GitHub Codespaces. If neither of these work, or if you really, really, really want a local installation, only then run the lab locally. InstruqtGitHub CodespacesRun locally Instruqt is a lab platform that provides cloud-based sandboxes which come pre-configured with all the tools you need to run this lab. Navigate to the Instruqt lab using this link. Fill out the form that appears and click Submit and access. Click Start to launch the lab environment. You should see a screen with a purple progress bar indicating that Instruqt is preparing a sandbox with all the required libraries for this lab and a MongoDB cluster. Once this is done, you should see a Start button at the bottom right of the screen. Click this to enter the lab. Connect to the MongoDB cluster​ Let's first connect to the MongoDB cluster that was created for you. This will allow you to view data we import into the cluster later in the lab, directly from the VSCode IDE. To do this, click the leaf icon in the left navigation bar of the IDE. This is MongoDB's VSCode extension. Under Connections, click the Local MongoDB Atlas connection. This should automatically establish a connection to the local MongoDB cluster running on port 27017. If the connection was successful, you should see a green leaf and a &quot;connected&quot; message appear around the Local MongoDB Atlas connection. You will also see the default databases in the cluster appear under Connections. Any additional databases we create during the lab will also appear here. Jupyter Notebook setup​ You will be filling code in a Jupyter Notebook during this lab, so let's get set up with that next! Within the codespace, click on the files icon in the left navigation bar of the IDE. In the Explorer menu, navigate to genai-devday-notebooks &gt; notebooks &gt; vector-search-lab.ipynb to open the Jupyter Notebook for this lab.

To perform vector search on your data in MongoDB, you need to create a vector search index. An example of a vector search index definition looks as follows:  { &quot;fields&quot;:[ { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;vector&quot;, &quot;path&quot;: &quot;embedding&quot;, &quot;numDimensions&quot;: 1536, &quot;similarity&quot;: &quot;cosine&quot; }, { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;filter&quot;, &quot;path&quot;: &quot;pages&quot; }, ... ] }   In the index definition, you specify the path to the embedding field (path), the number of dimensions in the embedding vectors (numDimensions), and a similarity metric that specifies how to determine nearest neighbors in vector space (similarity). You can also index filter fields that allow you to pre-filter on certain metadata to narrow the scope of the vector search.  Vector search in MongoDB takes the form of an aggregation pipeline stage. It always needs to be the first stage in the pipeline and can be followed by other stages to further process the semantic search results. An example pipeline including the $vectorSearch stage is as follows:  [ { &quot;$vectorSearch&quot;: { &quot;index&quot;: &quot;vector_index&quot;, &quot;path&quot;: &quot;embedding&quot;, &quot;queryVector&quot;: [0.02421053, -0.022372592,...], &quot;numCandidates&quot;: 150, &quot;filter&quot;: {&quot;pages&quot;: 100}, &quot;limit&quot;: 10 } }, { &quot;$project&quot;: { &quot;_id&quot;: 0, &quot;title&quot;: 1, &quot;score&quot;: {&quot;$meta&quot;: &quot;vectorSearchScore&quot;} } } ]   In this example, you can see a vector search query with a pre-filter. The limit field in the query definition specifies how many documents to return from the vector search.  The $project stage that follows only returns documents with the title field and the similarity score from the vector search.
